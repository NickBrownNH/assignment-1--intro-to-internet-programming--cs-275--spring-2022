         <h2 id="first-point">It Is Innovative</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted.
            Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original
            designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving
            technology, and can never be an end in itself.
         </p>
         <h2 id="second-point">It Makes a Product Useful</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but
            also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the
            usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract
            from it.
         </p>
         <h2 id="third-point">It Is Aesthetic</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because
            products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being.
            Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
         </p>
         <h2 id="fourth-point">It Makes A Product Understandable</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product
            clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best,
            it is self-explanatory.
         </p>
         <h2 id="fifth-point">It Is Unobtrusive</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
            objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and
            restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.
         </p>
         <h2 id="sixth-point">It Is Honest</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than
            it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises
            that cannot be kept.
         </p>
         <h2 id="seventh-point">It Is Long Lasting</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike
            fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.
         </p>
         <h2 id="eigth-point">It Is Thorough Down To The Last Detail</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design
            process show respect towards the consumer.
         </p>
         <h2 id="ninth-point">It Is Environmentally Friendly</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.
            It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout
            the lifecycle of the product.
         </p>
         <h2 id="tenth-point">It Is As Little Design As Possible</h2>
         <p class="normal-text">Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the
            products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to
            simplicity.
